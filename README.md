# Stumbling through my ~first~ second real try at linux desktop

## install

be sure to grab submodules too

```
git clone --recurse-submodules ...
```

Dependencies: yes!
Guess it's relevant to mention that i came from a KDE desktop base
... moved to install.sh, though It's probably not a complete list ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
(i use Arch btw)

Refer to JaKooLit's dotfiles on how to install sddm theme and gtk icons - or just use his stuff, since this is a no options or gui configs and strictly the way i want it

--

Since git cant keep files and then ignore future updates, a base for local confs can be added with

```
git checkout hypr_local_example -- dotconfig/hypr/conf.local.d/
git restore --staged .
```
